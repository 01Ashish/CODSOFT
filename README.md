## Task1 
TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
-> Used  Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data.
-> The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.
-> I have used Logistic Regression for binary classification.

## Task2
IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
-> The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. I have the measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species and I have trained a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.
-> Used the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks.

## Task3
SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON
-> Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.
->In businesses that offer products or services, the role of a Data Scientist is crucial for predicting future sales. They utilize machine learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. By leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their advertising strategies and maximize sales potential. Let'  s embark on  the journey of sales prediction using machine learning in Python.
-> Here I have used Linear regression because value which we need to predict is continuous varibale.
